Everything has been about computers to me. I didn't own one when I was a kid, my father tried getting me one, I didn't push him for it, I was grateful for what I had. (I had gaming consoles) Then as a gift, I got this:

That is an ADAM computer (yeah he got me the whole set) I even had a video game to go with it, Buck Rogers. Just one problem, I couldnt get it to work. It was second hand, and I never had a proper monitor for it, so I had it and it went unused. Sad, really, I would've loved to use it. 


I went to a vocational/technical high school. I mainly learned: word processing, CAD, and some electronics. The rest of my studies were a breeze since I was an honor student. I went to college, didn't know what to major in, was considering communications. I wanted to get my prerequisites out of the way. But even though I was an honor student throughout school, I still wasn't at college level, I had to take remedial courses, and I wasn't happy about that. I struggled at college (and I will maintain it is not for everyone) So I dropped out.

I had several jobs, mostly as Acounts Receivable, and I was overworked and underpaid. A/R is quite stressful, especially during tax season. The worst job I've had was at a five diamond hotel in NYC. I was glad that I was let go, but I decided then that a change was necessary as I couldn't handle another Accounts Receivable job. I had a temp assignment after that, which I liked a lot but I wasn't hired. Then I was offered another temp assignment, which I'm currently at. Six and a half years later. 

"How can you still be a temp after six years?" Yeah, I ask myself that question a lot too. While I work at a good company nice doesn't pay the bills. I was looking into what career I could transition into while working. Education & training had to be online, which is quite convenient for me. I kept seeing articles about learning to code and how important it was so I looked into it. I also looked into careers and what really interested me was the ability to work remotely, at startups, freelancing, etc The opportunities were truly endless! When I started to learn code, I liked it immediately, Yes it's challenging but it's a new skill there's always a learning curve, it'll be tough then it becomes easier. I liked what I was able to create with just HTML & CSS and I wanted to learn more which is why I chose this bootcamp. I also learned some Ruby before this bootcamp and it's my absolute favorite. I'm glad to learn Ruby here in better detail than the other course I was taking. 

I've only been learning to code for a few months, but it finally clicked and with this bootcamp, I'm eager to start freelancing, work wherever I choose and always continue learning. Here's to the journey and future endeavors!
